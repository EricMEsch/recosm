> **Note:** Some input files are missing because they contain confidential LEGEND internal data. Each sub-folder explains which files are required in its own `Readme.md`.  

If you are a **LEGEND member**, you can contact me to obtain the missing files. Otherwise, you can replace them with your own input files to explore alternative setups.

## Repository Structure

Each sub-folder contains its own `Readme.md` that explains its purpose and usage. Explore them individually to understand the workflow.
